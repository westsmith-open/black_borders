GUI to remove black borders from a
folder of images.

To run:
* Go to the Microsoft Store and install Python 3.7 (https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NJ46SX7X90P)
* Double click the run file (this will take a little while 
  the first time because it has to install some libraries)
  
If you have a set of images, it is worth trying different threshold values to see how much 
border gets removed. If you go above 280, it generally wipes the entire image.
